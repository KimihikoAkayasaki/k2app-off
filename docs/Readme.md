This folder contains several subfolders, for the purpose of different API usages
and also a built OpenVR driver for simplicity.
Purpose of different folders are described inside their Readme.txt-s.
You can find the built K2API with all needed files for both debug and release mode.
There is also an include folder, so generally it may be exportable.
Although, still - boost and ZMQ installed are needed for it to compile.
In case of any trouble, please head to K2VR's discord and yell at 「Akaya」.
