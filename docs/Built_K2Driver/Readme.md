This folder is a built K2Driver.
It can be used for testing or if you somehow cannot build it from the solution file.
To register it, either add the 'KinectToVR'-s foler path to openvrpaths in AppData
or register it with vrpathreg.exe, visible in SteamVR/bin/win64, using same path.
Speaking of 'KinectToVR' folder as the same which exists in the same folder, along with this file.
In case of any trouble, please head to K2VR's discord and yell at 「Akaya」.
