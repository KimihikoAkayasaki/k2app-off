This folder contains build-able version of sample program using the KinectToVR API,
later called K2API or via namespace name - ktvr.
Build instructions are in k2vr-application's repo docs, probably tagged with K2API.
C++ is fast, so it's going to be one of better choices for projects, while using the K2API.
In case of any trouble, please head to K2VR's discord and yell at 「Akaya」.
